# Psymple

`psymple` is a Python package designed for general complex systems modelling. A complex system is a dynamic system whose interconnectivity produces non-trivial or unexpected behaviour. Examples of complex systems exist everywhere, from ecological systems, chemical reactions, economic systems, astronomy and even social networks.

## Installation

`psymple` officially supports Python `3.10` and higher.

The latest version of `psymple` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/psymple/) and can be installed with `pip`.

```
pip install psymple
```
