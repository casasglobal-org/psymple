## Governance and steering

The package `psymple` is currently being produced under a collaboration between [CASAS Global](https://www.casasglobal.org/) and [IDEMS International](https://www.idems.international/).  Members of both organisations form the current core governance and steering team. In addition to being involved in the day-to-day community of `psymple`, this team maintains a collective responsibility for the development, maintenance and direction of `psymple` and are able to:

- Make decisions about the overall scope, vision and direction of the project.
- Make decisions about strategic collaborations with other organizations or individuals.
- Make decisions about specific technical issues, features, bugs and pull requests. They are the primary mechanism of guiding the code review process and merging pull requests.
- Update policy documents such as this one.
- Make decisions when regular community discussion doesnâ€™t produce consensus on an issue in a reasonable time frame.
